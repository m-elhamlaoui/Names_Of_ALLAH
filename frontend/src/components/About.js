        <p>
          Knowing the names of Allah is of great importance in the Islamic faith, as these names reflect the attributes and majesty of Allah. Understanding and memorizing these names allows believers to strengthen their relationship with God, deepen their spirituality, and find comfort and guidance in their daily lives. It is with this goal in mind that our quiz was created: to offer a fun and interactive way to learn the names of Allah.
